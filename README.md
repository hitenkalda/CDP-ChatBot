Support Agent Chatbot for CDPs
Overview
This project implements a Support Agent Chatbot designed to answer "how-to" questions related to four Customer Data Platforms (CDPs): Segment, mParticle, Lytics, and Zeotap. The chatbot extracts relevant information from the official documentation of each platform to deliver accurate responses. The chatbot is implemented with React and TypeScript, ensuring a maintainable, scalable, and user-friendly interface.

Features
Answer "How-to" Questions: The chatbot can understand and respond to platform-specific queries related to setup, profiles, audiences, and integrations.
Extract Information from Documentation: The bot retrieves information from the official documentation of Segment, mParticle, Lytics, and Zeotap.
Handle Question Variations: The chatbot handles various question phrasing, including long queries, and gracefully handles irrelevant queries.
Response Formatting: Enhanced response formatting with markdown support, structured responses (step-by-step instructions, titles, useful links, etc.), and a visual hierarchy for clarity.
Tech Stack
The following technologies were used to build this chatbot:

Frontend:

React: Chosen for building a dynamic, single-page application (SPA) that allows for smooth interactions with the user.
TypeScript: Used for type safety, ensuring a more robust codebase and preventing potential runtime errors by enforcing type checks.
Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework that provides flexibility in styling the user interface. It allowed for rapid development of a responsive and clean layout with minimal custom CSS.
Lucide React: A set of React components for icons, ensuring a modern, minimal, and user-friendly design.
Backend:

Node.js: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, chosen for its non-blocking, event-driven architecture that provides a scalable solution for building a chatbot backend.
Express.js: A minimal web application framework for Node.js, enabling fast and easy server-side development. It was used to handle requests and responses between the frontend and backend.
Content Extraction:

NLP Libraries (spaCy, Hugging Face Transformers) or Document Indexing (Elasticsearch, Haystack): These libraries were used for processing and extracting relevant information from the CDP documentation. These technologies ensure that the chatbot can retrieve accurate and relevant information from large datasets in the documentation.
Data Structures:

Arrays and Objects: Used for storing and organizing the chatbot’s responses, including lists of questions, answers, and related links.
HashMaps: For mapping questions to specific responses from the documentation, allowing for efficient lookups.
State Management: The React Context API was used for managing global states, such as the current chat history and the user's ongoing interaction with the chatbot.
Why These Technologies?
React & TypeScript: Chosen for their efficiency and maintainability. React allows for fast rendering and an interactive user interface, while TypeScript ensures type safety and improved developer experience.
Node.js & Express.js: These technologies provide a lightweight and scalable solution for creating the chatbot’s backend and ensuring that the user queries are handled quickly and effectively.
Tailwind CSS: Offers a fast way to develop responsive UIs with reusable classes. This approach helped to quickly implement and modify the layout without extensive custom CSS.
Elasticsearch (or NLP Libraries): These tools provide an optimized way of querying and indexing the documentation, ensuring that the chatbot can efficiently retrieve relevant answers in real-time.
